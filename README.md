# RAG_Model_Evaluation
This project evaluates answer quality in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline or large language model (LLM) using both semantic and keyword similarity. Scores are calculated using pre-trained language models for semantic analysis and traditional NLP techniques for keyword similarity, then combined to yield a final score.
